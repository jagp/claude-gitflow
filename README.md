# cc-gitflow-regulator

v0.0.1

Gitflow guardrails for Claude Code — every worktree flows back through the regulator.

Claude Code isolates background and parallel work in git worktrees on internal
`worktree-*` branches. Those branches don't follow gitflow naming, stay checked
out inside the worktree (so Sourcetree/GitKraken/git can't check them out —
`fatal: '<branch>' is already used by worktree at ...`), and nothing tells you
when the work is done. This plugin fixes all three:



- **Gitflow naming** — the moment a worktree is created, its branch is renamed
  to `feature/<name>`.
- **Fork from develop** — fresh worktrees are re-pointed to your gitflow base
  branch (`develop` by default), never whatever you happened to have checked out.
- **Completion alerts** — when new committed work exists, you get a desktop
  notification (Windows toast / macOS Notification Center / Linux
  `notify-send`) and, optionally, an [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) webhook you can
  build any automation on.
- **Local delivery** — at session end the worktree's HEAD is detached, which
  releases the `feature/*` branch so your git client can check it out or merge
  it immediately. Your repo is the remote: **nothing is ever pushed without
  you.**
- **Finish command** — `/finish-branch` performs the Sourcetree-style
  "Finish Feature" for you: release the worktree lock, `--no-ff` merge into
  develop (PR route on conflicts), and — only with your explicit go-ahead —
  kill the branch's Claude session and delete the branch.

## Requirements

- git ≥ 2.31
- bash (on Windows: Git Bash, which ships with Git for Windows)
- `jq` optional (a sed fallback is built in)
- a recent Claude Code — the rename hook matches the `EnterWorktree` tool and
  the notify hook uses `async` Stop hooks. Older versions degrade gracefully:
  no rename, and alerts run synchronously.

## Installation

```install
/plugin marketplace add jagp/cc-gitflow-regulator
/plugin install cc-gitflow-regulator@cc-gitflow-regulator
```

> If you previously wired similar hooks directly into `~/.claude/settings.json`,
> remove them when installing this plugin — otherwise both will fire.

## How it works

| Hook   | Event                            | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| rename | `PostToolUse` on `EnterWorktree` | Renames `worktree-<name>` → `feature/<name>`. If the branch is _fresh_ (a single `branch: Created from ...` reflog entry), hard-resets it onto the base branch first. Worktrees that already carry commits are never reset. |
| notify | `Stop` (async)                   | If the worktree is clean and HEAD moved since the last alert, sends the desktop notification + IFTTT webhook. Deduped by commit SHA — one alert per batch of new work, not per turn.                                        |
| end    | `SessionEnd`                     | Sends any pending alert, then detaches the worktree HEAD (releases the branch) so it is free in your main checkout.                                                                                                         |

Everything is scoped to directories under `.claude/worktrees/` — the hooks
never touch your own branches or checkouts. The script always exits 0; a
guardrail must never break a session.

## Configuration

All optional, via environment variables (e.g. the `"env"` block in
`~/.claude/settings.json`):

| Variable                        | Default                   | Purpose                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `CC_GITFLOW_REGULATOR_PREFIX`         | `feature/`                | Branch prefix for renamed worktree branches                                                                                                      |
| `CC_GITFLOW_REGULATOR_BASE`           | auto                      | Base branch to fork from. Auto-detect order: `develop`, `dev`, `origin/develop`, `origin/dev`. If none exist, worktrees keep their default base. |
| `CC_GITFLOW_REGULATOR_IFTTT_EVENT`    | `claude_work_done`        | IFTTT Maker Webhooks event name                                                                                                                  |
| `CC_GITFLOW_REGULATOR_IFTTT_KEY_FILE` | `~/.claude/ifttt-key.txt` | Where your IFTTT Maker key lives                                                                                                                 |

### IFTTT setup (optional)

1. Get your key at [ifttt.com/maker_webhooks](https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks) → Documentation.
2. Paste it into `~/.claude/ifttt-key.txt`.
3. Create an applet triggered by Webhooks event `claude_work_done`.
   Ingredients: `value1` = repo name, `value2` = branch, `value3` = detail text.

No key file → the webhook is silently skipped.

Keep the key file private (`chmod 600 ~/.claude/ifttt-key.txt` on macOS/Linux).
When a key is present, each alert sends the repo name, branch name, and alert
text to IFTTT — nothing else, and nothing at all without a key file.

## Reviewing and merging Claude's work

When you get the alert, the `feature/<name>` branch is (or will be at session
end) checked out nowhere — open your git client, review it, and merge it into
`develop` like any other feature branch. Delete it after merging as usual.

Or let the plugin do it:

## Finishing a branch: `/finish-branch`

```
/finish-branch [branch] [--kill-session] [--delete-branch]
```

Mimics Sourcetree's Gitflow **Finish Feature** button, deterministically
(all logic lives in `scripts/finish-branch.sh`; the command is a thin
wrapper). It first shows you a read-only *plan* — resolved branch, base,
holding worktree, attached Claude session, and whether the merge will be
clean — then:

1. **Releases the lock** — unlocks and detaches the `.claude/worktrees/*`
   worktree holding the branch (worktrees you created yourself are never
   touched).
2. **Merges** the branch into the base (`develop`/`dev`, or
   `CC_GITFLOW_REGULATOR_BASE`) with `--no-ff`, gitflow-style.
3. **On conflict**, switches to the PR route: pushes the branch and opens a
   PR into the base — the only case where anything leaves your machine, and
   it never happens without you having invoked the command. The PR body
   reminds you of the next step: once the PR is merged, run
   `/finish-branch <branch>` again and it resumes — detects the branch is
   now contained in the base and performs the remaining cleanup only.
4. **Optionally** kills the Claude session attached to the worktree and
   deletes its background job (`--kill-session`), and/or removes the worktree
   and deletes the branch with `git branch -d`, never `-D`
   (`--delete-branch`).

Both destructive flags are **off by default**. Claude will ask you before
using either one unless you passed the flag yourself or just approved the
same action moments earlier in the conversation — that explicit signal is
the only thing that enables them.

Guardrails: it refuses to run if your main checkout has uncommitted tracked
changes, if the branch's worktree is dirty (the work isn't finished), or if
the branch is held by a worktree the plugin doesn't manage. It will not kill
the session it is running in.
